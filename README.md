# Simple Notes Web Application

A simple **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** web application designed and implemented using **React.js** for the frontend and **Redux Toolkit** for state management.

## Features

- **Create Items**: Add new items to the list.
- **Read Items**: View and display a list of items.
- **Update Items**: Edit details of existing items.
- **Delete Items**: Remove items from the list.
- **State Management**: Efficiently handles application state using Redux Toolkit.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Built with React.js, providing a clean and intuitive UI.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - React.js
  - Redux Toolkit for state management
  - React Router for navigation (if applicable)
  
- **Styling**: 
  - CSS (or styled-components if used)

State Management with Redux Toolkit
The application uses Redux Toolkit to manage global state efficiently, following best practices for handling CRUD actions.

Slices: Each feature (or data type) is handled using a slice, which contains the reducers and actions for that part of the state.
Thunks: For asynchronous logic (such as fetching data from an API), Redux Toolkit Thunks are used to dispatch actions.
